# 8-bit Visual & Gameplay Rules

- All mini-games must use an 8-bit color palette, referencing NES/SNES hex codes for authenticity.
- All text and UI must use large, pixelated, TV-readable fonts—no smooth or anti-aliased type.
- UI elements (buttons, backgrounds, icons) must have a blocky, pixel-art look: no gradients, glossy effects, or modern shadows.
- The overall aesthetic should be inspired by retro consoles (NES, SNES, Sega) but must fit 1280x720 TV display.
- Controls: Only use the D-pad (arrow keys) and Enter; game mechanics should not require rapid/twitch inputs or precision timing.
- Game mechanics must be simple, replayable, and inspired by a **wide range** of classic arcade, puzzle, action, or sports games—not just clones of Mario, Tetris, or Snake.
- Visual identity and palette should take inspiration from the movie/show/event theme, but always remain within the 8-bit/pixel-art style.
